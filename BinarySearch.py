Problem statement
You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer 'target'. Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing. If 'target' is not present in the array 'A', return -1.

Note:
You must write an algorithm whose time complexity is O(LogN)

Sample Input 1:
7
1 3 7 9 11 12 45
3
Sample Output 1:
1
Explanation of sample output 1:
nums = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 45],
The index of element '3' is 1.
Hence, the answer is '1'.

Sample Input 2:
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
9
Sample Output 2:
-1
Explanation of sample output 2:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
Element '9' doesn't exist.
Hence, the answer is '-1'.
